## Deep Neural Network (DNN) Speech Recognizer

An end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline that accepts raw audio as input and returns a predicted transcription of the spoken language as an output. 

### Features
- Models are in `sample_models.py` (five different DNN architectures are explored)
- Full pipeline in `vui_notebook.ipynb`

### Data
- A subset of Librispeech, a large corpus consisting of 1000 hours of speech derived from audiobooks, was used
- Information available at http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf 

This project was completed as a part of Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.
